# appAuctionBidsWeb

The GBC Bids web application is an online auction system that allows registered users to buy and sell items. Visitors (unregistered users) can only search for auctioned products, but cannot bid or sell items.

Registered buyers can search and bid on auctioned items, while registered sellers can search for auctioned products and create their own listings to sell. Both buyers and sellers must log in to access their respective functionalities.

The application requires a registration process for new users, and authentication for subsequent logins. The landing page should be stylish and provide easy navigation throughout the application. Users can search for auctioned items using search filters, and sort the results by category or price.

Sellers can add new assets to the system and set a minimum bid amount and auction dates. They can also review, delete, or update their existing items. The application also includes a navbar and footer for ease of navigation and displaying group information.
